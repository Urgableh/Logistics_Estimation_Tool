What we need: an estimation tool used by dispatch callers to be able to glance at, monitor, input driver positions on a map that covers the general routes we undertake in the Pilbara, W.A. 

What it needs to include: 
The tool needs to be able to give the dispatch caller an immediate estimated travel time based on the inputs given. With alerts on driver fatigue compliance orders. 

A feature we’d like is to be able to see when drivers are expected to cross each other’s path. This will be ideal in setting up hours beforehand; a rendezvous for drivers to maximize hours on-road, and keep to fatigue management requirements.

The dispatch needs to be able to start route, pause route, cancel route, add to route. 

The dispatch needs to be able to add delivery points to the route in real-time. 

The tool will have a ‘bubble’ indicating the driver and show route progression assuming perfect travel conditions. 

The dispatch needs to be able to move the ‘bubble’ manually if a real position is confirmed. Route information like time to travel needs to be updated real-time. 

The dispatch needs to be able to input the starting time for a route and receive information back the distance in km, time to travel in hours, the time of estimated delivery, the time of estimated return to base. 

(Due to fatigue control, we have multiple ‘bases’. Tom Price, Newman, Auski Roadhouse, Nanutarra Roadhouse.)

If the driver is expected to be on-road beyond 12am, they need to go to the nearest base for the night. Travel time to the base also needs to be included as part of the route. (we’d like as close to 12am as possible) 
This tool will be used to be able to determine hours beforehand, that it is required to stop for the night. Alerting dispatch that the job is an overnighter, and the nearest base to book for accommodation. 

The tool needs to be able to have multiple tracking points, to be able to account for any and all drivers we have on the road. 

It is not a ‘live tracker’ but an ‘estimation’ so we can relay estimated travel time to inquirers, and be able to make travel commitments easily without worrying about exceeding fatigue protocol.
